This is Net::SFTP, a module implementing a client for the Secure
File Transfer Protocol.

PREREQUISITES

    * Net::SSH::Perl (2.12 or greater)
    * Math::Int64

In particular, Net::SFTP requires the SSH2 support in Net::SSH::Perl;
thus, during Net::SSH::Perl installation, you should choose that
you wish to use SSH2 support (and SSH1 support as well, if you want
that).

INSTALLATION

Net::SFTP installation is straightforward. If your cpan shell
is set up, you should just be able to do

    % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::SFTP'

If you don't like that, you can download the distribution; the
latest version on CPAN can be found in

    ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/D/DB/DBROBINS/

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

SAMPLES

Take a look at eg/psftp, an interactive SFTP shell using Net::SFTP,
for some examples on using Net::SFTP and its various methods.
